<p><br>If that <b>World Cup</b>was truly a battle of <strong>titans in every sense</strong> the <i>impending contest</i>is more or less a <mark>battle of the </mark>unequals<br>
India have hither to marched on immaculately in pursuit of a <small>third title and Sri Lanka</small> have lost more than what they have won. <br>
<del>Unbeaten in six straight games </del>and <ins>largely unchallenged </ins>for longer spans, <sub></sub>India have displayed <sup>traits of being </sup>a champion side which has the knack of <em>staging remarkable </em>fightbacks.</br></p>

<p><q>Sri Lanka are no pushovers but they have faltered more often than not in this World Cup</q> after an superlative show in the qualification round.<br>
 Injuries and unavailability of key players have also ravaged the team from the island nation, but its young brigade should make the most of facing a high quality opponent in its pomp</br></p>
